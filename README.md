# Natural Language Learning

This repository contains information pertaining to my endeavor in learning natural languages.

[Thai](thai/README.md)

Several researches have been performed that investigate the relationship between the repetition of words or phrases of words and the effect it has on the memorization of these. Nowadays, there is little or no attention by teachers on the drilling of new vocabulary, but research has proven that repetition, drilling is a very effective way of acquiring and remembering new vocabulary:

|Article| Description |
|--|--|
| [Pimsleur, the memory schedule](https://github.com/evowilliamson/natural-language-learning/blob/master/resources/Pimsleur_memory_schedule.pdf) | Paul Pimsleur investigated the concept of repetion in his famous article in 1967, supported by emperical research |
| [Individual language experience modulates rapid formation of cortical memory circuits for novel words](https://github.com/evowilliamson/natural-language-learning/blob/master/resources/Lilli%20Kimppa_learning_repetition.pdf) | Lilli Kimppa performed an excellent study, backed up by emperical and theoretical research regarding the repetition of novel stimuli |

Personally, I was introduced into the **Pimsleur** method about 15 years ago when I decided to study Chinese Mandarin. To my learning skills I added the technique of breaking down songs in verses and refrains and presenting them in a repetitive manner. until mastering the complete, without even understanding the complete meaning of the songs, but just by hearing and seeing the words. From that point I focused on grasping the meaning of the individual words and phrases until completely understanding it.

That method proved very effective and aided me a lot in acquiring the basics of Chinese Mandarin. Two years ago I decided to learn another East-Asian language, being Thai. I am applying the same method.
